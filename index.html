                <p class="project-description">Blivande is a collective and hub for participatory culture, artists and independent creatives in Stockholm, Sweden. We are based in a 1000 m2 building and a large container park. I co-founded Blivande in 2018 and led the strategy, fundraising, and project incubator for the first three years. I still advise the team on long term strategy and finances. </p>

                <p class="project-description">Babel Between Us was a literary experiment where 18 writers and 9 ethnographers from all over the world, over the course of two years, wrote collaboratively. The project resulted in a cartographic visualization of a collaboratively created world, exploring the uncharted waters between collaboration, fiction, and ethnography. Babel was funded by the Swedish arts council fund Kulturbryggan and concluded in 2022.</p>

                <p class="project-description">Participio was a development lab within Edgeryders, funded by the Swedish arts council fund Kulturbryggan. Our purpose was to build experimental software and methodology for decentralized organizations and co-created culture. Everything built by Participio is open-source and free to use. Cobudget was one of the projects that came out of the Participio Labs.</p>

                <p class="project-description">A platform for collaborative funding and participatory budgeting. It started in 2015 with a platform for decentralized curation for co-created festivals. We were funded by the Swedish innovation agency Vinnova to support participatory placemaking, and Kulturbryggan to serve culture and arts. We ended up merging with a similar open-source and became Cobudget.  </p>
